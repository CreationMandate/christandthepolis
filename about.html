        <h2>About This Project</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Christ and the Polis</strong> is a long-term theological study in progress. I launched this site as a space to explore, test, and reflect on a Reformed framework for political theology that is rooted in Christ’s threefold office—Prophet, Priest, and King.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          The Reformed world today is divided between camps: theonomy and reconstructionism, Christian nationalism, Two Kingdom theology, and quietist apathy. My conviction is that each of these contains some truth, but all tend to polarize or fall short in offering a fully Christ-centered approach.
        </p>
    
        <p>
          This site is my attempt to think carefully, biblically, and confessionally about what a political theology might look like when it begins with Christ Himself. I do not write as an expert or authority, but as a student of Scripture and the Reformed tradition seeking greater clarity and charity in a divided age.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          My name is Josh Johnson. I’m a husband, father of five, and a member of a church in the PCA.

This site reflects the intersection of my passions for Christ, the Church, public theology, and faithful Christian witness in the world.

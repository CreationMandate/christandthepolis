        <h2>Christ and the Polis: A Beginning</h2>
            <p><em>Rethinking Reformed Political Theology from the Groud Up</em></p>
            <p>In the Reformed world today, political theology is often shaped more by cultural urgency than confessional depth. Christians are asking important questions—about justice, authority, morality, and the role of the Church in public life—but the answers they receive are often filtered through well-worn camps that rarely engage one another directly.</p>
            <p>This site is not a new framework nor an attempt to launch a system to replace what's already out there. It's a space for reflection—a theological sketchbook. I aim to explore whether a historical and often underused doctrine might help us think more clearly and charitably about politics: the threefold office of Christ as <strong>Prophet</strong>, <strong>Priest</strong>, and <Strong>king</Strong></p>
        <h3>Four Camps, One Missing Table</h3>
            <p>Today, most conversations in Reformed political theology tend to orbit four distinct camps:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>The Apolitical Camp</strong> - This view leans toward withdrawal or silence in the political realm, often to safeguard the mission of the Church or avoid unnecessary cultural entanglement. It is motivated by a desire for spiritual focus but can slip into functional disengagement.</li>
                    <li><strong>The  Theonomic or Reconstructionist Camp</strong> - This perspective emphasizes the authority of God's law in public life and seeks to build explicitly Christian social orders. Its commitment to biblical authority is commendable, but it can sometimes blur the lines between ecclesial authority and civil jurisdiction or between spiritual renewal and cultural triumph.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Christian Nationist Camp</strong> - This position seeks to recover national identity, moral order, and cultural cohesion shaped by Christian tradition. It raises crucial critiques of secularism and social fragmentation but often lacks clarity in ecclesiology and in defining the role of the institutional Church.</li>
                    <li><strong>The Two Kingdoms Camp</strong> - This model distinguishes between Christ's spiritual rule over the Church and His providential rule over the civil realm through natural law. While it guards against ecclesial overreach and politicized pulpits, it can foster a kind of passivity or moral neutrality when speaking into public life.</li>
                </ol>
        <p>Each of these camps brings something valuable to the conversation:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>The Two Kingdoms tradition protects the independence of the Church.</li>
                <li>Christian Nationalism takes seriously the impact of apostasy on a people.</li>
                <li>Theonomy insists (rightly) that Christ's lordship is comprehensive, not compartmentalized.</li>
                <li>Even the Apolitical Camp is often driven by a pastoral concern for the purity of witness.</li>
              </ul>
        <p>But these camps rarely meet at the same table. Each is wary of the others, and many folks in the pew feel stuck between them—uncomfortable with extremes yet unable to find a home.</p>
        <p>This blog does not seek to establish a fifth camp but rather to return to a central confession of the Church: that Christ is our Prophet, Priest, and King—and that this confession may speak more deeply into political theology than we've allowed.</p>
        <h3>The Forgotten Framework: Christ's Threefold Office</h3>
        <p>The doctrine of Christ's threefold office is well established in the Reformed tradition. Christ is our <strong>Prophet</strong>, revealing God's will. He is our         <strong>Priest</strong> , interceding and mediating. He is our <strong>King</strong>, ruling over all things for the good of His people.
            Yet when the conversation turns to politics, this framework often disappears.</p>
        <p>What if our political theology started with Christ's person and work, not with reaction or resistance?</p>
            <ul>
                <li>What would <strong>prophetic politics</strong> look like? Not outrage or propaganda, but public truth-telling shaped by divine revelation.</li>
                <li>What would a <strong>priestly posture</strong> toward politics offer—a witness of mercy, humility, and intercession?</li>
                <li>And what does it mean to live under the <strong>kingship of Christ</strong>—not as theocratic control, but as joyful submission to His just and holy reign?</li>
            </ul>
        <p>I don't have answers to all these questions, but they are worth asking, and we have neglected this lens for too long.</p>
        <h3>What This Blog Is (and Isn't)</h3>
        <p>This blog is not a new system, a call to war, or a partisan platform.</p>
        <p>It is:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>A theological sketchbook</li>
                <li>A confessional attempt to ask old questions in a Christ-centered  way</li>
                <li>A long-form meditation on the offices of Christ</li>
                <li>A place to slow down, think aloud, and invite dialogue</li>
            </ul>
        <p>If you're burned out on ideological extremes, uncertain where you fit, or simply hungry for a political theology that starts and ends with Christ—I hope this space is helpful to you.</p>
        <p>Not because I have the answers.</p>
        <p>But because I believe Christ does.</p>
        <p><strong>Soli Deo Gloria</strong></p>
